Task Description:
This Python script implements a basic speech-to-text system using the SpeechRecognition library with a pre-trained model. It enables transcribing short audio clips into text.

Features:
1. Uses the SpeechRecognition library for audio processing.
2. Converts spoken words in a .wav file to text using Google Speech Recognition API.
3. Handles errors for unknown audio and connectivity issues.
4. Accepts an input audio file and returns a transcribed text output.

Usage:
- Place the .wav audio file in the same directory as the script or provide its full path.
- The script loads and processes the audio, converting speech to text.
- The transcription result is printed to the console.

This tool is useful for automating speech-to-text conversion in various applications, such as note-taking, accessibility tools, and voice commands.
